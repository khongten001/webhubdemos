[GetServerVariable] 
APPL_PHYSICAL_PATH=Retrieves the physical path that corresponds with the metabase path. IIS maps the namespace to the physical directory path; this allows APPL_MD_PATH to return this value. This is a costly function (in run time) compared to getting just APPL_MD_PATH. 

AUTH_PASSWORD=Specifies the value entered in the client's authentication dialog. This variable is only available if Basic authentication is used.  

LOGON_USER=The Windows account that the user is logged into. 

PATH_TRANSLATED=Specifies this is the value of PATH_INFO, but with any virtual path expanded into a directory specification.
