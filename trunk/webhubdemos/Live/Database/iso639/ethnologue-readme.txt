Terms of Use for Language Code Download Tables

In the interest of fostering the use of ISO 639-3 for the uniform 
identification of all the world's languages in information systems, 
SIL International releases certain information from the Ethnologue 
database for use in the development of information systems, 
specifically, information that describes language identifiers in terms 
of alternate names and countries where spoken. You are welcome to 
download the information as provided and incorporate the supplied 
tables into your own database application. You are also authorized 
to make that application available to the public, provided that you:

- cite SIL International and this web site (www.ethnologue.com) as the
    source of the information, 
- do not modify or extend the codes other than those set aside for local
    use (i.e. qaa to qtz), and 
- use only the data in the tables and no other data posted on this site.
    Rather, other information on this site should be accessed by supply-
    ing a link like the following (where abc is an ISO 639-3 code):

        http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=abc 

SIL International periodically updates the supplied information, and 
intends http://www.ethnologue.com/codes/ to be the sole distribution 
source in order to ensure uniformity of versions. You are not authorized 
to redistribute the downloadable code tables, whether in the exact form 
they were obtained from this site or in a modified form you have 
developed, without the written consent of SIL International.
