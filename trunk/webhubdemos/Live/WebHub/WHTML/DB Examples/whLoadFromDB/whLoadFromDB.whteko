<whdroplet name="defFil�Powder">
<p>Fil� powder, also called gumbo fil�, is a spice made from dried and ground sassafras leaves. It is used in the making of some types of gumbo, a thick Cajun soup. It is sprinkled sparingly over gumbo as a flavoring and thickening agent, giving it a distinctive flavor and texture. Mixing okra and fil� is considered a cardinal sin in Louisianan cuisine, as fil� was originally an okra substitute when okra was not in season.
</p><p>Safrole, the main constituent of sassafras oil which is distilled from the bark of sassafras roots, has been shown to cause liver cancer in laboratory rats, and this has caused concern over the use of fil� powder. For this reason, major grocery-store spice brands sell a mixture of other herbs as fil� powder. However, sassafras leaves contain little or no safrole. Genuine sassafras is available from specialty suppliers and is used extensively in Louisiana.
</p><p>Cajun gumbo begins with a deep brown roux, to which are added vegetables (pepper, onion, celery, garlic, and tomato) then a seafood stock made from shellfish shells, pepper, bay leaf, and thyme. Okra, which came with African slaves, or sassafras file (dried, ground leaves of the sassafras tree), borrowed from Native American cooks, is added as a thickener. After the stew cooks for two hours or so, loads of fresh shrimp and crabs are added. The gumbo is ladled over buttered rice.

<p>WebHub Note: this data is stored in the WHTEKO file, not in the Paradox database, because UTF-8 encoding 
of the accented � in Fil� is so helpful. If we were using a FirebirdSQL table, this entry could be stored in the database.

<p><strong>Fil� powder</strong>, also called <strong>gumbo fil�,</strong> is used in the making of gumbo, a thick Cajun soup. Together with okra, it provides the distinctive flavor and texture of the soup.</p>
<p>Traditionally, fil� powder is made from sassafras, which has been shown to
cause liver cancer in (~waLOCAL|lab~) studies [1]. For this reason, major
grocery-store spice brands sell a mixture of other herbs as fil� powder. Genunine sassafras is available from specialty
suppliers, who claim that the health risks are negligible when ordinary amounts of fil� powder is used.</p>

<p>Fil� powder has also been made traditionally from Sassafras leaves, which do not contain safrole, the volatile oil linked with cancer in lab rats. Fil� powder made from sassafras leaves can still be found
commercially and is used extensively in Louisiana.</p>
