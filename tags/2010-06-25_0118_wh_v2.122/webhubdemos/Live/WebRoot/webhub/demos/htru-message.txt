The HTRU demo is offline because we have not yet tested it with WebHub v2.073

The Delphi Super Page search engine uses WebHub and Rubicon,
and is fully operational at http://dsp.href.com.

Furthermore, this photo artwork site ( http://www.photovisionsbydc.com ) also 
uses WebHub and Rubicon.
