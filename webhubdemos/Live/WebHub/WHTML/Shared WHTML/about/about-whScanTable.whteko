<ul>
<li> Requires whScanTable.exe</li>
<li> This demo is able to display data using the Borland Database Engine "BDE" 
and/or dbExpress.  There is a toggle within the Pascal code to select the database 
connection type, and there is a checkbox in the GUI to toggle as well.</li>

<li> When using the BDE, a table named graphics.db is required, and should be located in
the projects\webhubdemos\Live\Database\whScanTable directory.</li>
<li> When using dbExpress, the connection goes to a Firebird SQL table located  
on the demos.href.com server and open to the public.</li>
</ul>

<whtranslation key="~whDemoShortDescSCAN">
This demo shows how to make a WebHub database application where the "look" of 
the database display is defined in W-HTML and can be changed without recompiling.
It uses the TwhdbScan component.  
</whtranslation>


<whtranslation key="~whDemoLongDescSCAN">
This demo is set up to allow easy customization. The W-HTML calls a 
TwhdbScan named "browseScan" and passes in the name of a droplet. 
The component uses that droplet 3 times in 3 different ways:
<ol>
<li> To initialize the table display, it sends everything prior to the &lt;whrow...> tag.</li>
<li> For each row in the database being displayed, it sends everything within the 
&lt;whrow...> tag.</li>
<li> At the end of the table, it sends everything after the &lt;/whrow...> tag.</li>
</ol>
That enables the HTML specialist to 
control every aspect of the table's appearance -- colors, layout, everything!

<p>The Grid Options page lets the surfer change a number of factors that determine 
how the grid is displayed, just to give an idea of the type of variety that 
is possible by making various portions of the W-HTML based on session 
variables.</p>
